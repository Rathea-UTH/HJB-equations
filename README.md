# HJB-equations

The aim of this project is to test different schemes for HJB equations. A first part concerns first order HJB equations, related to deterministic control, where it is more easy to study the numerical schemes, the stability and monotonicity of the schemes. A second part concerns the approximation of a second order HJB equation (uncertain volatility model) including an example (for development) from the article [Bokanowski et al., 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310329326_High-order_filtered_schemes_for_time-dependent_second_order_HJB_equations)
